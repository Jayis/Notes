# Original question
Can you provide an example of when you had to work with a difficult team member?  
How did you handle the situation?

## My Answer
I once worked with a colleague who was difficult to get along with. Although he was not in our group, our work had an upstream and downstream relationship, so I often had to assign tasks to him or discuss implementation details with him.

In this context, I am the manager of the AI team and the main point of contact between our team and other teams. He is responsible for integrating our models into the system on the system side.

His main issue was that he would often question the necessity of the tasks assigned to him and resist carrying them out.

At that time, I used the following methods to collaborate with him:
1. **Inquire about the basis of his doubts**: If it was based on his past experience, I wanted to know more.
2. **Demonstrate the importance of the task**: Present evidence of other companies improving by implementing this feature.
3. **Involve authority**: Inform him that the matter was decided by the company's higher-ups, and if he could not refute based on evidence or propose an alternative solution, I believed that execution would be the best choice.

After several such incidents, he gradually began to refuse my proposals less. I believe there has been a significant improvement in our collaboration.

### Feedback from Jamie
- highlight my position, to let them know why you're taking the approach.
- why take alot of time to cater a person like this, your ability to lead might be questioned  
  -> we work closely, so that guiding him is also one of my leadership

我曾經與一位不好相處的同事共事過
雖然他並非是在我們組上
但由於因為我們的工作具有上下游關係
所以我時常需要交辦任務給他，或與他討論實作細節

在這邊我是 ai team 的 manager，是 ai team 這邊與其他 team 主要的對接窗口
而他是在系統端負責將我們的模型整合進系統的人

而他主要的問題是他會常常會以質疑交付他人給他的任務的必要性並排斥執行任務

在當時，我曾用以下這些方法來跟他合作
1. 詢問其質疑的基礎：如果這是基於他過去的經驗，我想知道的更多
2. 向其展示任務的重要性：提出其他公司有做這個 feature 而改善的證據
3. involve authority：告訴他這件事是由公司高層決定的，若無法基於證據提出反駁或提出其他的替代方案，我認為執行會是最好的選擇

在經過這樣的事件幾次之後，他漸漸的就比較少在拒絕我的提案了
我相信我們的合作應該是有顯著的改善

### Intention of the question
The interviewer wants to understand your ability to work with diverse personalities, handle conflicts professionally, and maintain a positive work environment.

### Pitfalls to avoid
Avoid speaking negatively about the difficult team member or blaming them entirely for the situation. Refrain from suggesting that you were unable to handle the situation or find a resolution.

### Sample Answer 1
In a previous project, I had a team member who was frequently late in delivering their assigned tasks. This affected our overall progress and deadlines. Instead of getting upset, I approached them privately to understand the reason for the delays. They were struggling with some personal issues and felt overwhelmed. I offered my support and suggested breaking tasks into smaller, manageable parts. This approach helped them get back on track, and our teamwork improved significantly.

### Sample Answer 2
I once worked with a colleague who had strong opinions and often disagreed with the rest of the team. To handle the situation, I made an effort to listen to their perspective and find common ground. I encouraged open and respectful discussions where everyone could express their thoughts. By fostering a collaborative environment, we were able to reach a consensus on various issues and make better decisions as a team.
