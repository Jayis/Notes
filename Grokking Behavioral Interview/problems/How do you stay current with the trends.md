# Original question
How do you stay current with the latest developments and trends in the software engineering field?

## My Answer
I usually receive the latest information through social media. I follow several groups, such as Meta, PyTorch, and Montreal AI. I also follow some people who work in the ML and CV fields or who are passionate about these areas.

When there are major updates, I check to see if they have released any arXiv papers or technical reports. If it's truly groundbreaking or extremely relevant to my field, I will make time to read it thoroughly. In recent years, such things might include vision transformers, neural radiance fields, Tesla AI Day, and so on.

Sometimes, I also seek advice from former colleagues or seniors from my school days that is not easily found online. They may guide me towards some directions that are worth paying attention to.


### Feedback from Jamie
- rather than using "quick-scan", "filter" would be a better phrasing
- give examples of "actively" search for information

### 中文版本
我通常透過社群媒體來接收最新的資訊
我有 follow 一些社團，像是 meta, pytorch, montreal AI 之類的
我也有 follow 一些同在 ML, CV 領域工作，或是對這領域有熱情的人

當有重大的更新時，我會去看看他們是否有釋出 arXiv paper 或 technical report
如果真的是 groundbreaking 或者與我的領域極度相關，我會再找時間認真讀過
近年來，類似這樣的東西可能像是 vision-transformer, neural radiance field, 
Tesla AI day, 等等

有時我也會向前同事或是在學時的學長
尋求一些在網上不容易找到的建議
他們可能會指引我去關注一些值得關注的方向
