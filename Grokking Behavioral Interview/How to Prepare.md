## STAR
### Situation
Essential background information to **understand** the **challenges** and **constraints** you faced.  
Remember to maintain a professional tone and avoid sharing overly personal or confidential information.  
It's important to strike a balance between providing enough context and not overwhelming the interviewer with too much information.  

Relevent details:
- work environment
- team dynamics
- project goals
- external factors

### Task
This component highlights your **role** and the **expectations** that were placed upon you.  
Describe the specific **goals**, **deadlines**, or **deliverables** that you were working towards, and explain why they were important to the team or organization.

When discussing the task, emphasize the **challenges** you encountered and any **obstacles** that made it particularly difficult or complex. This will help the interviewer understand the level of responsibility you had and the skills required to successfully complete the task.

### Action
Describe the actions you took, the **thought process** behind your decisions, and any **strategies** or **techniques** you employed to overcome the challenges you faced.

Focus on your contributions and be clear about your role in the situation.

### Result
Describe the positive outcomes that resulted from your efforts, such as successful project completion, improved efficiency, cost savings, or enhanced team dynamics.  
If possible, **quantify** your results with specific numbers or percentages to give the interviewer a clear sense of the scale of your achievements.

In addition to the immediate results, discuss any lessons you learned or skills you developed through the experience.  
This demonstrates your ability to reflect on your experiences and grow professionally.

## Be Mindful About
- Use "I" instead of "we"
  - While teamwork is essential, interviewers want to know about your specific contributions to a project or situation. Use "I" to describe your actions and responsibilities, and emphasize how you contributed to the team's success.
- Stay positive and focus on growth
  - When discussing challenges or setbacks, maintain a positive attitude and emphasize what you learned from the experience.
