# Coding Interview Roadmap
https://www.designgurus.io/path/coding-interview-playbook

This roadmap is consisted of four courses
- [Grokking Data Structures & Algorithms for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)
- [Grokking the Art of Recursion for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20the%20Art%20of%20Recursion%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20the%20Art%20of%20Recursion%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)
- [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](./Grokking%20the%20Coding%20Interview-%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions/Grokking%20the%20Coding%20Interview-%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions.md)
- [Grokking Dynamic Programming Patterns for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)

## Steps in Coding Interview
1. problem clarification
   - constraints
     - boundaries
     - data types
     - how big is the input
2. idea explanation  
   - idea generation
     1. focus on the information flow, from input to output
     2. then focus on how the information is processed
   - **illustrate** through examples
   - if it forms a method, **evaluate its complexities**
3. algorithm walk through
   - write algorithm down
   - use example to trace the **algorithm**, **step-by-step**
4. code development
   - use example to trace the **code**, **line-by-line**
   - be sure to act like a computer, run what you see, not what you think
5. test case generation

### Algo design canvas
1. Constraints
2. Ideas
   - Strategies to generate ideas
     - Simplify the task
     - Try a few examples 
     - Think of suitable data structures
     - Think about related problems that you know
   - Evaluate complexities for each ideas
3. Code
   - Think before you code
   - Code outside your IDE
4. Test cases
   - Extensive testing
     - Edge cases
     - Cases where thereâ€™s no solution
     - Non-trivial functional tests
     - Randomized tests
     - Load testing
   - Sample tests **(for interview)**
     - a small-scale version of a non-trivial functional test, to make sure the code does the right thing
     - edge cases
     - no solution cases
