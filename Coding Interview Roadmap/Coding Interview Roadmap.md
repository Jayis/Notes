This roadmap is consisted of four courses
- [Grokking Data Structures & Algorithms for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20Data%20Structures%20and%20Algorithms%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)
- [Grokking the Art of Recursion for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20the%20Art%20of%20Recursion%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20the%20Art%20of%20Recursion%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)
- [Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions](./Grokking%20the%20Coding%20Interview-%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions/Grokking%20the%20Coding%20Interview-%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Questions.md)
- [Grokking Dynamic Programming Patterns for Coding Interviews](./Grokking%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Interviews/Grokking%20Dynamic%20Programming%20Patterns%20for%20Coding%20Interviews.md)

## Steps in Coding Interview
1. idea explanation  
   - **illustrate** through examples
2. algorithm walk through
   - write algorithm down
   - use example to **trace** the algorithm, **step-by-step**
3. code development
   - use example to **trace** the algorithm, **line-by-line**
4. test case generation
5. complexity analysis
