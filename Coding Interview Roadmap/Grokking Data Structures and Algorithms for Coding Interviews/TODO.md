# TODO
Due to time limitation, below topics were left undone.  
Plz finish it someday.

## Trie

## Sorting
### Advanced Sorting Techniques
- counting sort
- radix sort
- bucket sort

## Searching

## Greedy Algorithm
### Standard Greedy Algorithms
- Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm: Builds a minimum spanning tree by adding the shortest edge that doesn’t form a cycle.
- Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm: Grows a minimum spanning tree from a starting vertex by adding the nearest vertex.
- Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm: Finds the shortest path from a single source to all other vertices in a weighted graph.
- Huffman Coding: Used for data compression, it builds a binary tree with minimum weighted path lengths for given characters.
- Fractional Knapsack Problem: Maximizes the total value of items in a knapsack without exceeding its capacity.
- Activity Selection Problem: Select the maximum number of activities that don't overlap in time.
- Greedy Best-First Search: Used in AI for pathfinding and graph traversal, prioritizing paths that seem closest to the goal.
